CrowdFunding Token

Anyone can submit an application for funding his/her business idea on our crowdfunding site at https://cft.cash.
If your application is approved, you will receive funding in the form of CFTs from the Payment Fund.
When carrying out each transfer of Crowdfunding Token (CFT), a fee is charged from the sender, by which the Payment Fund is replenished.
